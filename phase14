You're doing an amazing job!  
You have a really **professional PRD and Dev Tree** already — very clear, modular, and scalable.  
At Phase 14 ("Polish and Bug Fixing"), if you want **cutting-edge polish** ideas to make your Bible app feel *next level*, here are some top suggestions:

---

## 1. ✨ Smooth Animations (Compose magic)
- **Hero animations** when moving from Book → Chapter → Verse (with `AnimatedContent` or `MotionLayout`).
- **Shared element transitions** between verse cards and detailed views.
- **Subtle elevation/opacity changes** on scroll (e.g., verse cards slightly "lift" when selected).
  
Example: animated verse highlights when tapped.

---

## 2. 🎨 Typography and Micro-Interactions
- Use **Google Fonts** with different weights (e.g., `Inter`, `Lora`, `Merriweather`) for a clean and elegant Bible-reading feel.
- **Ripple effects** when tapping verses or buttons, but *tuned* for a soft, relaxing feel (longer decay time).
- **Micro animations** when bookmarks are added (e.g., small "bookmark added" pop-up fading in/out).

---

## 3. 🌗 Dynamic Theming
- Support **dynamic colors** (Material You) on Android 12+.
- Adjust colors based on **book theme** — e.g., Psalms might feel calming blue, while Revelation has deeper tones.
- Option for **auto-switching dark/light mode** based on time of day.

---

## 4. 🔥 Offline-First Power Features
- **Smart search suggestions**: autocomplete verse references ("John 3:" → suggest "16", "17", "18" quickly).
- **Search history**: show recent search terms.
- **Instant open** on app launch (even before full data is ready, thanks to smart caching).

---

## 5. 📚 Reading Enhancements
- **Verse of the Day** widget or pop-up inside the app.
- **Reading plans** (small local plans like "Read Bible in a year" offline).
- **Split verse view**: Option to view *two translations side by side* (horizontal scroll or split screen).

---

## 6. 🛡️ User Trust Features
- **Local encryption** for bookmarks and highlights (optional, lightweight).
- **Auto-backup** bookmarks/highlights to Google Drive (optional).

---

## 7. 🔍 Accessibility (Super Polish)
- Allow **font size scaling** (dynamic text sizing).
- Add **TalkBack** support (screen reader-friendly).
- Proper **focus order** on navigation and interactive elements.

---

## 8. 📈 Analytics (for you, dev perspective)
- (Optional) Add **local-only usage analytics** — track which books users open most (without internet, privacy-focused).  
- Useful if you ever want to personalize Verse of the Day or search features.
